# Work Day Scheduler Challenge

The goal of this project was to make a scheduling application that dynamically changed based on the time of day, and saved tasks that persisted in the browser.

To complete this task I did the following:
    Used Moment.js to make the time blocks for each hour of the work day change color to show whether or not that hour was in the past, was the present hour, or was in the future.
    Used Bootstrap utility classes to style the HTML on the page.
    Utilized jQuery to write shorter and more readable JavaScript. It also helped me traverse the DOM to compare information in the time blocks to information saved in localStorage.
    Saved task information and its associated time block to localStorage. Retrieved information from localStorage every time the page loads.

By completing this project I learned a great deal about utilizing third party APIs. This was my first time using Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js. While it took me a lot of time and effort to figure out how to use these libraries, it is clear that as I master these tools I will save an incredible amount of time when coding. I look forward to learning more about what is possible with these tools.
